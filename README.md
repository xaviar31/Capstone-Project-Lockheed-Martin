# Capstone-Project-Lockheed-Martin
This project optimizes energy storage by managing charge and discharge schedules to minimize costs and maximize profits. This is done by using robust optimization, price forecasting, and Monte Carlo simulations to handle uncertainties. It also includes a check node to ensure reliability.
